    ## SALT and AMT Basics

    **SALT:** Filers can take an itemized deduction for (a) property taxes and (b) _either_ state and local income or sales taxes. The TCJA capped the SALT deduction at \$10,000 from 2018 to 2025; beginning next year, it is scheduled to be uncapped. [Learn more about how we model SALT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ATmkzrq8e5TS-p4JrIgyXovqFdHEHvnPtqpUC0z8GW0/preview).

    **AMT:** Filers must calculate their tax liability under the regular tax code as well as the alternative minimum tax and pay the higher amount. The AMT disallows certain preference items, including but not limited to the SALT deduction, the miscellaneous deductions, and the personal exemptions. The TCJA has (1) expanded the exemption amount that applies to AMT-specific income and (2) increased the threshold at which this exemption phases out at a rate of 25%. [Learn more about how we model AMT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uAwllrnbS7Labq7LvxSEjUdZESv0H5roDhmknldqIDA/preview).
    
    ## What We'll Demonstrate

    In this analysis, we'll show how the interaction between the SALT deduction and AMT creates an **effective SALT cap**. We'll demonstrate that while the SALT cap is officially removed in 2026, the AMT effectively limits how much state and local as well as property tax certain households can deduct, creating a de facto cap that's different from the current explicit \$10,000 cap.
    
    Along the way, we'll introduce two key concepts:
    - **"Property tax subsidy rate"** - a new metric that measures what percentage of each additional dollar in property taxes is effectively subsidized through federal tax savings
    - **"Effective SALT cap"** - the maximum SALT deduction a household can benefit from, even when no explicit cap exists
    
    We'll examine these through:
    1. Detailed case studies of multiple households at different income levels
    2. Comparison of tax calculations at \$5K, \$10K, and \$15K property tax levels to reveal how the benefit of additional property taxes changes
    3. Visualization of these effects across a wider range of property tax amounts

    ### Alternative Minimum Tax

    The alternative minimum tax computation begins with the regular taxable income which is increased to compute the alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI). Firstly, the personal exemption amount, which was reduced to $0 under the TCJA, is added back to the taxable income. For non-itemizers the standard deduction amount is also added back. For filers who itemize, the SALT deduction and other preference items, which are excluded from regular taxable income, are included in the AMTI calculation.
    
    The AMTI is then reduced by an exemption amount, which phases out for higher income levels, before a tax rate of either 26% or 28% is applied to determine the **tentative minimum tax**. (Additional rules may apply for households with capital gains and dividend income.) Table 3 shows the tentative minimum tax for each scenario.

    ### Property Tax Subsidy Rates

    One way to assess the impact of these tax policies is by examining how much of a household's property taxes is offset by reductions in income tax liability. The **property tax subsidy rate** measures what percentage of each additional dollar in property taxes is effectively subsidized through tax savings.
    
    For example, if a household pays an additional \$5,000 in property taxes and their federal tax bill decreases by \$1,250, their property tax subsidy rate is 25% (\$1,250 รท \$5,000). This means 25% of each additional property tax dollar is effectively subsidized through federal tax savings.
    
    When a household is subject to the AMT or hits the SALT deduction cap, their property tax subsidy rate can drop significantly or even reach zero, meaning they receive no federal tax benefit from additional property tax payments. Table 4 summarizes the key tax calculations and shows the resulting property tax subsidy rates.

        #### Figure 2: Subsidy Rate Chart
        This chart shows the property tax subsidy rate - the percentage of each additional dollar of property tax that is effectively subsidized through tax savings. 
        
        Several key patterns to observe:
        - Flat lines indicate no additional tax benefit from property tax increases (0% subsidy rate)
        - Downward slopes indicate diminishing benefits as property taxes increase
        - Step changes often indicate when a household transitions from regular tax to AMT or hits deduction limits
        
        Some of the marginal subsidy rates also reflect state-level property tax related deductions and credits.
